# Domingo

A not-so-smart virtual assistant


## Installation

1. Clone
2. `pip install -e .`


## Usage

    domingo [-p PREFIX] [-s SETTINGS] [-v] [-?]


### Commands

Domingo can answer some basic questions, try the following phrases:

- What's the time?
- What's up?
- Roll a dice
- Thank you
- Is it raining? / Is it raining in X?
- Is it snowing? / Is it snowing in X?


#### Custom commands

Use the `-s` argument to specify a file with your own commands and normalizations


### Prefix

Domingo will listen to all your conversations and interrupt you if he knows the answer

Make Domingo less annoying using the `-p` argument to specify a command prefix, e.g. "ok domingo"
or "hey domingo"


## Disclaimer

This is not a serious project and I have no plans on maintaining it, don't use it
